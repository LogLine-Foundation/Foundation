# Press Release — LogLine Foundation (EN)
**Date:** 16 Nov 2025  •  **Location:** Lisbon

LogLine Foundation launches as a **flagship for fully digital, verifiable governance**, combining **Human–AI partnership**, **peaceful use**, and **transparency by default**.

**Highlights**:
- Public decision ledger (**JSON✯Atomic**) with **BLAKE3 + Ed25519** and mandatory *machine gate*;
- **CPLP Portuguese** as a companion language, with dual PT–EN canonicity;
- Computable rites (proposal → vote → minutes → policy → directive → execution) with SLOs and audits;
- Proof tooling: **CLI**, **Ledger Viewer**, **GitHub Action**.

**Quote**:
> “A decision without proof is an opinion. With LogLine, every act has **hash, signature, and rite**.” — Board
